Ion tables on luttero: /data2/specwizard_versions/ionisation_tables_2018_11_07

compiled on quasar (make.quasar)
main issue seems ot be getting the same compiler as was used for hdf5 and mpi
modules:


used gcc compiler for c
mpif90 for mpi
consistency required between compiles in eagle subfolder (read_eagle), specwizard main, and hdf5 wrapper

hdf5 wrapper:
lots of warnings on compile (looks like type casting + unused variables issues)
a few similar warnings crop up when compiling read_eagle
similar long list in specwizard compile

stuff I changed:
mpiifort -> mpif90
split some lines that were too long for the compiler

fix for MPI (Tom Theuns, with help):
get each MPI process to write a separate file, to avoid different processes trying to write to the same file simultaneously.
(barriers were in use, but the process would reach the barrier before all the writing was actually done.)
