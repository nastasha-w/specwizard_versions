# specwizard_versions
This is a repository for storing (and hopefully merging) different versions of specwizard and/or version control for your own copies of it.

this branch: 
-----------
version that works on cosma5 (Durham)

finding the right hdf5 version is an issue, addressed in the makefiles here and in the hdf5_wrapper (not included in this repository)

modules:
--------
  module load intel_comp/2018-update2
  
  module load intel_mpi/2018
  
  module load hdf5/1.8.20
